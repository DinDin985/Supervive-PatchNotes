  # Hey SUPERVIVERs,

  ![Lifetime Players](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/lifetime-players.png "Lifetime Players")

  > note: looking for IMMEDIATE action? [Go read our week 1 patch notes here]("/patch-notes/patch-1-01" "supervive-patch-notes.app")

  DAMN. It’s been just one week since Open Beta, and already so many of you have jumped in, brought your friends,
  and given us great feedback. Fun fact: our playerbase has tripled since Steam Next Fest and we’ve just passed ONE
  MILLION LIFETIME PLAYERS since being in development. We’re humbled, we appreciate all of you for coming out, and we
  really mean it when we say we’re just getting started.

  ![Roadmap](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/cover-image.png "Roadmap")

  So how about we share some of that future energy now. We know with any new game launch—no matter how good—the
  immediate following question is: what’s next? You’re an insatiable bunch.

  But this is what we’re built for, so let’s start… from the beginning (okay, July):

  ## HOW WE GOT HERE,

  ![Current Position](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/roadmap-current-position.png "Current Position")

  Since a majority of you are joining us from either Steam Next Fest or Open Beta (right now), you might not know
  how we’ve been developing SUPERVIVE in the open. With almost every monthly patch, we’ve done some combination of:

  - Big swings to improve major parts of the game (like the entire evolving equipment system or our strategic objectives rework)
  - Sweeping art passes as we elevate Hunters, the environment, the lobby, and the UI to our ideal vision
  - A whole lot of balancing and polish
  - And a ton of changes big and small based on all of your feedback

  We’re not going to stop doing all of these in Open Beta and beyond - as you can see from our very first post-open-beta
  patch. That said, moving forward we are thinking about how we want to package these into something more… eventful.

  ## NOV/DEC - OPEN BETA & THE COSMIC WINTER JUBILEE,

  ![Nov & Dec](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/roadmap-nov-dec-2024.png "Nov & Dec")

  We love seasonal events because they give us clear thematic ideas to work with, and we get to… go crazy. And even
  though open beta just happened, with winter around the corner we knew we had to do something fun for the holidays.

  SO. This December, we’d like to invite you all to our Cosmic Winter Jubilee. With it will come new Powers, new
  Storm Shifts, new game mechanics, new cosmetics, and thematic changes to the Breach (that’s our map). You might
  also meet someone… new in your adventures. Who says no to free gifts?

  ## JAN/FEB/MAR - SEASON 0, ARC 1: [REDACTED]’S WARPED TOUR,

  ![Jan/Feb/Mar](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/roadmap-jan-feb-mar-2025.png "Jan/Feb/Mar")

  Not only will we have new environments, mechanics, and Hunters on the way, we’re also going to be taking some
  swings at a few parts of SUPERVIVE’s gameplay - similar to how we evolved equipment.

  Now, because of the way we iterate with your feedback (and learn as we go), there’s no promise we’ll have new
  features or systems that we want to move forward with. But there are some design spaces we think are worth investing
  time and development into.

  Examples: we’d like to come back to equipment in some way, if just to continue expanding on your available build
  options or adding more spice to your high-rolls. We’re also looking to lean into that ‘warped’ theme, with new
  reinterpretations of classic zones, powers, and items (classics of all of two months, hah). Finally, we’re interested
  in exploring more endgame variance and how your gold/shard economy works together.

  Once again, like everything we do, these aren’t set in stone as we’ll learn a lot from your feedback, and likely
  add in new priorities based on that feedback. For example, ranked improvements have shot up our priority list (as
  demonstrated by our week 1 patch - and more coming), as well as getting improved social features and looking into
  better support for solo queue players (fair warning: a pure solo queue is likely not it, as that has massive knock-on
  effects for squad queue).

  We’ll also be rolling out our very first battlepass for you to progress. To note: we’ll have some VIVE Points in
  there for you to unlock for free, and once you’ve purchased one battle pass, we do plan to let you go infinite (that
  is, earning enough through regular play to unlock the next).

  So this is us sharing our current priority list for the next couple months. We’ll continue updating as we go.

  ## APR/MAY/JUN - SEASON 0, ARC 2: [REDACTED] of [REDACTED],

  ![Apr/May/Jun](/news/dev-roadmap-to-the-future-of-supervive/roadmap-apr-may-jun-2025.png "Apr/May/Jun")

  Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves here. We’ll just say: we’re cooking! We’ve already got some hunter prototypes
  in development, as well as an overarching theme to do with the Abyssals of SUPERVIVE. Don’t know what those are? You
  will :^)

  All up: we have big surprises in store for next year and we want to build with all of your feedback, so keep it
  coming and we’ll share more at the start of 2025!

  P.S. If you haven’t already, we’d love for you to review the game! We promise we’re reading every review (positive
  or negative) and prioritizing accordingly.

  P.P.S. Also: heard on the OCE server (or lack thereof) sadness. Totally understand the negativity; playing on 170
  ping is brutal. Just to be honest: our biggest challenge with OCE servers is maintaining a healthy queue population,
  which affects matchmaking, queue times, etc. Much bigger studios with much bigger games have launched OCE servers and
  had to shut them down due to low population. Ultimately it’s a risk we can’t yet take as a new, independent studio that
  isn’t yet profitable. One day we’d like to at least have servers closer to OCE, but we gotta get this plane off the
  ground first. Thank you to those playing through the ping and supporting us - sorry we don’t have the answer you’re
  looking for!
