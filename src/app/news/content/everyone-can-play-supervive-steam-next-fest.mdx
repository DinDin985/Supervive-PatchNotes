  # Prefer reading? We can summarize:

  Everyone will be able to play SUPERVIVE on Steam, 24/7 during Steam Next Fest (October 14 to 21).

  Also if you play during Steam Next Fest, you can unlock a unique glider at launch that you can’t get anywhere else, ever.

  We're making our permanent home on Steam moving forward, so make yourselves comfortable here. Ideally that includes:
  Following us on Steam
  Wishlisting us on Steam
  Telling your friends about us (on or off Steam)
  … please :)

  To all previous playtesters, this playtest will be hosted only on Steam. Please go to your 
  [Theorycraft account page](https://accounts.theorycraftgames.com/ "accounts.theorycraftgames.com"), 
  link your Steam account, and then download, install, and launch SUPERVIVE on Steam.

  Patch notes will also be posted on Steam moving forward. Let me tell you, it is a de-light to have more formatting 
  options for patch notes.
