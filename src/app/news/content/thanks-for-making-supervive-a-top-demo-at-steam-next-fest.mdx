  Thanks all for the incredible Steam Next Fest playtest! Being one of the TOP-PLAYED DEMOS was nice, but here are some stats that really made us happy:

    - Hundreds of thousands of new players played SUPERVIVE for the first time
    - NEW players played at least 20 games on average!
    - 67 MILLION minutes / 127 YEARS of SUPERVIVE were played in just 1 week!
    - 13 million hunters were killed during this test
    - 3.5 million vaults were attempted... and 70% of them were fails (lmao)
    - s/o VITEK for slamming 93 hours of SUPERVIVE and Tharkum for playing a whopping 471 games this test!

  If you had fun

  Now it's time to support our Korean Closed Beta happening /RIGHT NOW/ and we'll be back with future news.
