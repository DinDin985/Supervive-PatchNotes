  It's time for some EVENTS to close out Steam Next Fest for SUPERVIVE! Come in the following days for...

  Friday, October 18 - Solos Event mode
  Starts: 5AM PDT / 8AM EDT / 2PM CEST
  Ends: 11PM PDT / 2AM EDT / 8AM CEST
  Throw balance out the window and become the 1v39 hero
  NOTE: If you queue as a trio in squads, you may experience particularly long queue times due to more solo players queueing for... well, solos. Try to fill out your squad to speed things up!
  NOTE: There is currently a bug with solos where you will get reduced or zero Hunter's Journey experience from playing the game mode - sorry about that!

  Saturday & Sunday, October 19 & 20 - Ranked Weekend
  Starts: SAT - 5AM PDT / 8AM EDT / 2PM CEST
  Ends: SUN - 11PM PDT / 2AM EDT / 8AM CEST
  We do a mixed queue in SUPERVIVE where ranked players and unranked players get matched up. Unranked players can DESTROY the happiness of ranked players by obliterating their ranked points at no cost to themselves, which is delightful!

  As a final note, you may experience ~30% longer queue times during these events as we are tightening up MMR bands for closer matchmaking, as well as (obviously) adding in a new queue. Thank you for all your patience!
