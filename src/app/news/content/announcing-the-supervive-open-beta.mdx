  # Announcing: The SUPERVIVE Open Beta

  ## Coming sooner than you think!

  # You asked, we listened!

  Seeing all of your energy from Steam Next Fest and our Korean Closed Beta has motivated us to move Open 
  Beta as early as we possibly can, and now we have an official date: **November 20th, 2024**.

  This is ultimately a bet on YOU, the community, our development, and SUPERVIVE’s momentum. Not only have 
  we put in a lot of work to make this Open Beta build sing, we’ve already got a lot of new content cooking 
  just around the corner.

  Wishlist us on Steam to be notified when we're live, and we'll see you all there!
