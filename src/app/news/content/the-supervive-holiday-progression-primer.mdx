  ## HUNTER MASTERY PASS,

  Running until January 8, 2025, every level of Hunter Mastery you have or earn over this time will contribute 
  that amount of points toward the Hunter Mastery Pass (so if you have Hunter Mastery 1 for Celeste, you’ll 
  have 1 point—if you progress to Hunter Mastery 2 for Celeste, you’ll gain 2 points, totalling 3 points).

  Get enough Hunter Mastery levels spread across any number of hunters, and you’ll unlock enough VIVE Points 
  to unlock any legendary variant (or a bunch of goodies in the shop), as well as an exclusive Santa (?) wisp 
  and titles!

  ## HUNTER MASTERY LEVEL 6,

  We’ve added another reward to Hunter Mastery level 6, which grants 150 VP - enough to buy a rare skin! This 
  change is permanent so don’t feel like you gotta hit 6 right now - we’re just letting you know.

  ## AN EXPANDED HOLIDAY STORE & VIVE POINTS FOR MORE COSMETICS,

  In case you were wondering what to do with those points, we’re expanding the shop to include rare skins, 
  gliders, wisps, and emotes that can all be purchased with your earnable VP.

  ## 2X REFER-A-FRIEND POINTS,

  This was put in last week, but just to remind everyonewe are now granting 2x refer-a-friend points for 
  everything, as well as resetting point tracking, so you can play with all of your referrals again for even 
  more points!

  HAPPY SUPERVIVING, SUPERVIVERS.
