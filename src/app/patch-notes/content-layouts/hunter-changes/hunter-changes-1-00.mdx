# Hunters

## Ghost

Ghost is looking weak across the board. Giving him a little more damage & mobility to bring him back into the fold.

### (LMB) - MK7 Glyph Rifle 
- Damage increased by ~5%

### (SHIFT) - Combat Slide 
- Cooldown reduced from 12/9/8 >>> 11/8/8 seconds
- NOTE: The level 2 to 3 change was not in the tooltip and not intended, so this is just buffing lvl 1 & 2, and leaving lvl 3 the same

## Hudson

We're seeing Hudson looking pretty dominant across all MMRs. Gun should go brr, but his mobility and range were feeling pretty out of line.

- Aim laser now accurately shows range, both empowered and unempowered

### (LMB) - Minigun
- Unempowered projectile range reduced from 1500 >>> 1400

### (SHIFT) - Hover Jets
- Hover duration reduced from 2/2/2.5 >>> 1.4/1.4/1.75 seconds

## Jin

Our resident hot assassin is looking a little weak. This is also the last time we will use objectifying language for Jin, but he has recently just come into hotness and so we must celebrate (momentarily). To the change: we expect Jin to get better as people get more games in, but this small change should help him get there a bit quicker.

### (RMB) - Flash Dagger
- Cast warmup reduced from 0.3 >>> 0.1 seconds

## Myth
- Recommended item changes from Rampage >>> Mindblade (it's better for her)

## Shiv

Shiv was impacted disproportionately by a tech change to more precisely control projectile ranges. This change gives her a little more threat range so she can function better at mid range.

### (LMB) - Arcslinger 
- Base range increased from 800 >>> 850
- Empowered range increased from 925 >>> 950
