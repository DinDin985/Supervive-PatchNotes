# Equipment
These changes are mostly based on data we’re seeing - specifically: evolution pickrates, win rates, etc. Small nudges here and there to bring things in.

## Vampiric Axe
- All evolutions of Vampiric Axe are underperforming, so this is a category-wide buff:
- Base Omnivamp increased from 7.5% >>>8.5% (the in-game tooltip rounds up so it’ll look like 9%, sorry. Also: all evolutions get this buff)

## Swiftblade
- Self-heal on empowered attack increased from 50 >>> 60

## Rampage
- Ability Power at max stacks reduced from 50 >>> 40
