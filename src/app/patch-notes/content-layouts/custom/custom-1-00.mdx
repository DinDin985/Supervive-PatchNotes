# Ranked

Coming into Open Beta, we knew there was still work to do, but wanted to get the game in your hands to validate feedback before digging into our competitive systems. Well… heard, chef! We were already working on a ranked upgrade for January/February, but have started yoinking things up to NOW per your feedback. So before we get to changes:

FOR THE FUTURE we would like to do a more comprehensive overhaul with plans for better leaderboards (friends, social, regional), rewards, and competitivityness. We also hear you regarding ranked feeling more grind-based than skill-based (we have some hypotheses as to why) and that doomed feeling as a solo player getting run over by a premade, but no promises yet, just plans.

FOR NOW: given all the constraints of shipping a patch within a week of launch and using the tools we have, we think we have a fun, temporary solution for the holidays.

- Anyone with more than 500 Ranked Points at Legend Rank will get reset back to 500 RP (this is to recalibrate the top of the ladder competition with our new premade restriction rules)
- Squads Master+ Queue will now be limited to duos premades at most
- Duos Master+ Queue will now be limited to solos at most (this has been reverted due to community feedback!)

Oh... you might say, is that it?

# CUSTOM GAME ACCESS FOR LEGEND+

If you’ve ever been the top 0.01% of anything (couldn’t be me), you’ll know it’s lonely at the top and no matchmaking algorithm will save you when you’re just… better. Something something bell curves. Giving custom game access to Legend+ players lets these gifted SUPERVIVERS play socially after grinding through Masters with halved premades, while also upholding a core community philosophy of Theorycraft: the power of self-organization! There’s simply no way a formula can matchmake the best, but you can, through the power of friendship. Godspeed.

P.S. inevitably we’ll be asked about why not giving Custom Lobbies to everyone so I will speedrun the context:

- Individual games of SUPERVIVE cost us for each instance hosted - meaning a 1-player game of SUPERVIVE is about as expensive as a 40-player game (this is me generalizing to an extreme)
- Custom games also pull players out of the matchmaking pool, which harms matchmaking quality and queue times
- Therefore: giving custom game access is very scary for us from a cost and game quality perspective
- We’re gonna do it anyway (for Legend+ players) until January 15 because we don’t have other acceptable solutions for our very best

---

- **At MONDAY, 12PM PST, we will manually grant every player who is ranked Legend+ (duos and squads) the ability to host custom games for the whole week. Since it’s not Monday, we have already done this week's grants**
- If you fall out of Legend+ rank during the week, you'll retain access to custom games until the next sweep on Monday, so you have until then to reclaim your standing
- Custom games include the ability to set storm shifts, powers, and game modes. They are also a little janky (it’s a dev tool currently) so pardon the dust
- You can access Custom Games through the queue dropdown menu in the top left
- This is a temporary solution and will be removed on January 15th, 2025
- You must have at least 8 players in the lobby to start - we reserve the right to increase this threshold if things get scary (undefined). There is also no indicator as to why you can’t start (it just won’t start until you get 8+), so consider this patch note to be your UX
- Legend+ players, if you want us to set up something on our official Discord to help you organize, reach out to PWYFF - otherwise it’s in your hands now

# Death Circle

We've heard lots of feedback on the changes to the initial circle size. While we believe the smaller size has improved our early game pacing—especially in cases where things feel real empty for the first few minutes—we also hear that some drop paths end up feeling claustrophobic.

We’d like to preserve our current game pacing, but want to alleviate that feeling, so let’s try this first set of changes. Keep the feedback coming!

- Initial circle radius has been increased by +10%
- The first circle will still close in the same amount of time, so it will feel faster once it starts closing
