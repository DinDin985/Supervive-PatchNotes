# Powers

## Two-Way Teleporter
Some of y’all are sleeping on this power (and we know who because we’re tracking drop rates), so we're hoping light buffs will make it more exciting to hold on to. Some tips: teleport resurrection beacons! Pre-drop teleports for mid-fight flanks! Try third-party kidnapping someone from a fight! Oh the possibilities!

- Cooldown reduced from 100 >>> 70 seconds
- Minimum delay on reactivation reduced from 10 >>> 8 seconds (so it’s faster to teleport)

## Bungee Shot
Philosophically we feel the same as above (cool power y’all sleeping on), so we’re gonna buff it until you like it >:^)

- Cooldown reduced from 20 >>> 16 seconds
- Shot warmup time reduced from 0.2 >>> 0 seconds (so it’s near instant)
