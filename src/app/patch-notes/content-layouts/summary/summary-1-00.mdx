# Summary

"Hi SUPERVIVERs! We’re still deciding how we want to label our patches, so for now you get functional names and nothing numerical. We reserve the right to change based on our whims.

Aight let’s get to it. For this patch, we’ve been looking at the data and listening to your feedback, trying to formulate a set of mostly numerical changes for balance, along with some bigger changes to the ranked experience. RE: deliberately staying lighter on balance—we’re not taking massive swings because everything is fresh and things are rapidly changing. We want to leave space for metas to form and re-form, especially as knowledge is shared and y’all figure out how to counter Shrike.

Seeing a week one patch might also prompt questions as to what our desired patch cadence is, to which I’d say: we’re thinking one more BIG patch in December, then bi-weekly patches starting mid-Jan. Or maybe you’re asking about what our FUTURE CONTENT PLANS are, to which I’d say: READ THIS ψ(｀∇´)ψ"
