# Bugfixes

- Fixed Felix’s name in French
- Fixed issue where AFK detection would kill players even when they return from being AFK
- Fixed Shiv’s Secret Agent Golden Gun Chroma so it isn’t pulling from base gun textures in-game
- Improved ping retry on region latency check to reduce issues where players get disconnected entirely from the internet due to spam
