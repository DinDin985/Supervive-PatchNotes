  # The SUPERVIVE Cosmic Winter Jubilee is here!

  ## Come experience holidays in the breach

  ### DinDin | 12/11/2024

</Introduction>

<Summary authorName={"DinDin"} authorImg={""}>
  "Welcome… to the SUPERVIVE Cosmic Winter Jubilee! We’ve been cooking up a STORM for the holiday season, 
  with delightfully themed powers, treats, environments, and more. And while you’re out there murdering in 
  the breach (as one does), make sure to say hi to the lil’ gift giver roaming the land."

  Let’s get started:
</Summary>

<PatchHighlights video={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfVkok1mO4k"} img={""}>
  
</PatchHighlights>

<Custom title={"Double Refer-a-Friend Points!"}>
  "The holidays wouldn’t be the holidays without the homies :)"

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - You now get double the points [5 >>> 10] when your referred friend plays a game of SUPERVIVE and plays a game with you
  - We have also reset referral tracking, meaning you can play with all of your referred friends again for even more points! Your total points will roll over with this reset
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Clone Squad event queue & All Hunters Unlocked Weekend!"}>
  "What better way to learn Hunters than if... everyone plays the same one >:)"

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - From Thursday, December 12 @ 6AM PST to to Sunday, December 15 @ 9PM PST, we will be opening up a new event mode: Clone Squads where everyone on your squad will play the same hunter. We will also unlock all Hunters for everyone during this time!
  - The game will randomly select a Hunter for the whole squad based on what everyone has selected
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Ranked Restriction Revert"}>
  "We made these changes last week ([and announced them on X](https://x.com/jbelliss/status/1864174572960141687 "x.com")) but I wanted to put it into the patch notes for 
  posterity's sake. A summary of the context is... last patch we put in squad size party restrictions for 
  Masters+ players to try to balance out giga-stompy squads comprised of the literal top 4 players of SUPERVIVE.
  On checking through the data, it seems that the change just didn't do what we wanted, so we're reverting. We 
  also acknowledge there's a real hard trade at the highest levels of play between competitive integrity and playing 
  with friends. If your friends happen to be great at SUPERVIVE, your sum of parts becomes... basically unbeatable. 
  We know this, you know this, and we're going to let it ride for now.

  In January we already have some ranked upgrades cooking, but in the meantime let's just slam games with our friends 
  and see how much RP there is to be harvested in the world."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - We have reverted the Masters+ Squad restrictions on both Duo and Squad queue, so you can queue up with 4 teammates at all ranks
  - We have also tightened up matchmaking at the top-end. This will mean if you’re in the top 1% of players and queue as a 4-stack, you’ll be subject to longer queue times than before
  - Any player who is ranked Legend every Monday at 12pm PST will still gain access to custom games for that week (this will run until January 15th)
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Upcoming Progression & Store Changes on December 18th"}>
  "We’re jumping backwards and forward through time right now, but wanted to give you a heads up of some progression 
  & store changes we have planned for our **December 18th patch**. A big theme we've been hearing is that there isn't 
  enough progression content to unlock in the game. We are cooking up our battlepass for Season 0 but didn't want to 
  wait that long. So here are some changes going live on December 18th.
  
  We've also heard your feedback that waiting to buy a skin for your hunter is annoying. We'd like to have enough 
  content that we can rotate the shop and have something to always buy, but we just won’t be there for some time. 
  So for now, we're going to put all the skins we have ready in the store through at least January 15. This should 
  give us some time to make more - our ideal is to have at least one purchasable skin option for your Hunter at any 
  point in time, so we’ll slowly move toward that reality."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - We are adding Hunter Mastery level 6 for all Hunters, with a 150 VIVE Point reward (if you are Hunter Mastery level 6 on any Hunter already, you can claim this immediately)
  - We are also adding a ‘Hunter mastery pass’ that will grant limited-time rewards for how many Hunter mastery levels you have in total
  - We are adding the option to purchase rare-level skins, some wisps, gliders, and emotes for VIVE Points in the store
  - The store now has all currently available skins for purchase (including ones that already rotated through). This rotation will partially update with our early January patch.
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Cosmetics"}>
  "New Cosmetic Rotation!"

  New Twitch Drops: 

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - Two holiday Vive Pup emotes for DEC 11 to JAN 1
  - Two Korean-themed Shrike emotes from our NEXON partners for JAN 1 to JAN 20

    - Trapped Players can now leave early:
    - After a player has been dead for 3 minutes without being revived, they're allowed to leave the game
    - The ‘early exit’ button appears after 90 seconds of being dead, along with a timer showing how long until you can leave
    - Your ally's status has a progress bar and countdown that'll appear with 90 seconds remaining
    - Fixed the bug that would cause discord and other applications to quit working if SUPERVIVE was left running for a long time. - Special thanks to AidanBY, Zendrex for helping us tracking this down

<HunterChangesContainer>
  <HunterChanges imgBig={"/patch-notes/hunter-portraits/oath-full-body-cropped.png"} imgSmall={"/patch-notes/hunter-icons/oath.png"}>
      ## Oath

      #### Wall stun duration reduced, Q healing reduced, no longer repairs broken shield and only heals shield when active.

      ### "Oath has been dominant in the competitive scene for some time now, establishing himself as a “must pick” character in most comps. We’re looking to create more opportunities for enemies to take advantage of his broken shield, and also removing some of his chain CC potential."

      <Hr className="hidden w-11/12 mb-8 lg:block" />

      <HunterAbilityChangesContainer>
        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/oath/passive.png"} abilityName={"(Passive) - Valiant Strength"}>
          - Reduced wall stun duration from 1 >>> 0.5 seconds
        </HunterAbilityChanges>

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/oath/Q.png"} abilityName={"(Q) - Regen Field"}>
          - Healing reduced by 20% at all levels
          - No longer repairs broken shield
          - Only heals shield if shield is active

  <HunterChanges imgBig={"/patch-notes/hunter-portraits/zeph-full-body-cropped.png"} imgSmall={"/patch-notes/hunter-icons/zeph.png"}>
      ## Zeph

      #### RMB heal reduced and min time between heals increased.

      ### "Speaking of dominant competitive picks, Zeph has also stood out as the meta Protector pick for some time now. We’ve also heard a lot of feedback about how strong his burst healing feels compared to Elluna, so we’re hitting that."

      <Hr className="hidden w-11/12 mb-8 lg:block" />

      <HunterAbilityChangesContainer>
        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/zeph/RMB.png"} abilityName={"(RMB) - Mending Breeze"}>
          - Heal reduced by 15%
          - Minimum time between heals increased from 0.5 >>> 1.5 seconds

<EquipmentChangesContainer>
  <EquipmentChanges equipmentImg={"/patch-notes/equipment-icons/amplifier.png"}>
      ## Amplifier

      #### 

      ### "I know seeing two sets of Amplifier nerfs sounds like a lot, but Amplifier’s cooldown reduction interacts with equipment cooldown reduction in stronger than anticipated ways, and we’ve been getting ongoing feedback from our veteran players that Amplifier is still extremely strong. We’ll share some math:"

      <EquipmentSpecificChangesContainer>
        - Bonus CDR per stack reduced from 5% >>> 2.5%
        - For comparison:
        - Pre-nerf: two haste items without Amplifier gave 32% cooldown reduction
        - Pre-nerf: two haste items with a fully-stacked Amplifier gave ~60% cooldown reduction on the amplified ability
        - Post-nerf: two haste items with a fully-stacked Amplifier will give ~50% cooldown reduction on the amplified ability
        - [Bugfix] fixed some cases where a single ability case would stack Amplifier multiple times (Brall tether)
