  # MAR 19 - The Mana Rework and Objectives Patch

  ## Bosses spawn mechanics updated, mana reworked, ability haste reworked, and Hunter balance!

  ### DinDin | 3/19/2025

</Introduction>

<Summary authorName={"DinDin"} authorImg={""}>
  Hello hello SUPERVIVERS and welcome back to another patch. This one might seem small in word count, but each line means 
  a lot, so read everything! All of it!!! Thematically, I’d say our orientation is toward making the game and combat state 
  of SUPERVIVE more intuitive, action-oriented, and appreciable. This is just step one toward that goal, and our next patch 
  - the launch of Arc 2! - should feel like a significant evolution for SUPERVIVE, so stay tuned.

  P.S. Also, fireside chat is coming next patch as well to talk about where we are and where we’re going. Thanks for your 
  patience!

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Bosses, Signaling and Spawning

    "Currently bosses are easy to miss for a variety of reasons. We want to make them more consistent in delivery, ceremony, 
    & timing to see if it helps you plan and strategize around them. Basically, we want you to always know (and be thinking 
    about) when Bosses will arrive, where Bosses will land, and how to stay informed of a Boss’s location and health so you 
    can contest them."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - All Bosses ride into the world on meteors and have an updated schedule
    - At the start of a night, meteors launch and take 45 seconds to land
      - Night 1: 3 Night Bosses (two with exotics, and one with a legendary)
        - A third night boss will now also spawn at a set spawn point

      - Night 2: Meteor Beasts (which drop souls)
      - Night 3: Nothing
      - Night 4: Endgame Boss (which drop powerful endgame buffs or items)
        - Endgame boss map icon now shows which one it is
        - Endgame boss spawn rate adjusted to from 90% >>> 100%

    { /* Comment for spacing */}

    - Meteor mechanism now additionally projects where they will spawn on the map, so you don't need to guess / infer where they'll be
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Bosses, Acquisition/Stealing

    "Philosophically I’d say we prefer more action-oriented plays, like securing the last hit on a monster to claim a buff
    versus standing around mashing F on a pedestal."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Meteor Boss soul pedestal removed
    - Whoever lands the killing blow on the Meteor Boss gets the soul instantly for their team
    - Whoever lands the killing blow on Endgame Bosses also gets all of the rewards automatically placed into their inventory (if your inventory is full, it goes on the ground because you clearly didn’t want it)

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Bosses, Rewards

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Landing the killing blow on Soul Warden instantly respawns all of your dead allies, in addition to dropping an extra Orb of Life and Mobile Respawn Beacon
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Revival Mechanics

    "We’re trying to clean up early teamfights so they’re less clown-y, without pushing revival timers too far."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Revival timers increased by 5 seconds
  
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Ability Haste/Dash Haste Separation

    "Ability Haste is just too strong in SUPERVIVE, specifically because anyone who stacks it gets high uptime on their 
    abilities and lots of extra mobility (because their dash is also an ability). This makes Ability Haste a must-take on 
    a lot of Hunters - even LMB-focused ones who should be inclined to chase movement speed. So now we’re asking that you 
    trade something for ability spam versus incredible dash mobility, and giving more value to leveling up your boots early."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Ability Haste reduces all cooldowns >>> just ability cooldowns
    - Introducing a new stat: Dash Haste, which reduces just dash cooldowns
    - Tech Blade & Tech Helmet base ability haste has been increased from 15% >>> 20% + 1% per tier
    - Quickblade & Bladed Helmet base stats:
      - 30 movement speed + 2/level >>> 15 movement speed + 1/level
      - 0% Dash Haste + 0%/level >>> 10% Dash Haste + 1%/level
    
    - Boot base stats:
      - 5 movement speed + 6/level >>> 5 movement speed + 10/level
      - 0% Dash Haste + 0/level >>> 0% Dash Haste + 2%/level
  
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Air Dash Speed

    "In our effort to pull mobility back (and make it more appreciable), we nerfed air dashing (that is: jumping and using 
    a dash) in a number of ways to make it less of a “yeet” and more of a dash. Now with our ability haste/dash haste 
    separation to reduce mobility overall, we think we can revert one nerf that felt the worst."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Air Dash Speed multiplier increased from 0.85 >>> 1.0 (meaning it no longer applies a small amount of friction when using an air dash)

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Mana ‘Rework’

    "Oh mana. We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on mana through the years, like, “How come some Hunters seem to need mana,
    while others don’t?” or more directly: “Why does it exist?” Just to answer for the current state of things, mana may 
    not be the most well-implemented stat in SUPERVIVE, but it does add some build diversity for a few Hunters and is 
    generally unoffensive.

    That said, we know mana can be a lot more interesting as a stat and, if done right, could feel like a universally 
    valuable optional stat rather than a per-Hunter required one. So with this patch we’re trying a new version of mana 
    that might feel closer to energy or stamina: your abilities use mana to cast (per usual), but your mana regen is 
    halted for 4 seconds after spending any mana. We’ve also significantly boosted everyone’s mana regeneration (provided 
    they haven’t used an ability in the past 4 seconds), and removed mana regeneration from items (and decreased the +max 
    mana stat).
    
    Zooming out, the way we think about it is we want mana to be a short-term resource that gates you on the total number 
    of actions you can take per fight rotation (and then you’ll need to find moments to regenerate), rather than being a 
    long-term resource that you occasionally have to manage by going back to a basecamp and chugging a billion brews (or 
    just negating all up).

    You can also build max mana as a stat to increase your total ability casts in a fight, but not to the point where 
    you’re ignoring mana forever. This shouldn’t feel very restrictive (if anything, it may be too generous), but let’s 
    start here!"

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Base mana regen 1.5 >>> 11 per second
      - Bonus mana regen per level 0 >>> 2.6 per second
      - The result is: at level 1, it takes 12 seconds to fully regenerate your mana, and at level 15, it takes 6 seconds. Previously it was 1.5 to 3.5 minutes.
    
    - Mana regen is paused for 4 seconds after spending any mana
    - Mana Equipment has been changed to give 150 + 7.5/level max mana + 1.5 + 0.1/level mana regen >>> 100+ 5/level max mana + NO mana regen

    #### Q health reduced, RMB damage increased and upgrades changed.

    ### "I’m not going to continue writing fan-fiction about the Beeb-omb supremacy and how sentience has made them more frail as they grappled with the fragility of their lives and existence, but imagine I did and I hope you are emotionally moved. From a balance perspective, we’re trying to give some counterplay to the case of Beebo planting a bomb and holding a bat threateningly (forever) while the bomb tanks a billion damage. We’re also trying to make Slingshot Beebo a little more appealing and skill-expressive."
