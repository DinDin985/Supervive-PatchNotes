  # Patch Notes 1.00

  ## Happy Hunting Supervivers!

  ### DinDin | 11/20/2024

</Introduction>

<Summary authorName={"DinDin"} authorImg={""}>
  "Hello Supervivers! We are excited to get the servers up and running for all
  the players to enjoy the game we've been working so hard on. 
  
  New features will
  be up for showcase this patch such as Jin and Shrike's new in-game character
  model and a brand new system called Quests. We hear your feedback on too much
  downtime within the early game after hitting max level. A couple of things
  we're doing to combat this is to shorten the first day and night cycle as well
  as introduce a new in-game system called Quests. 
  
  We want to continue developing this game to make it in the best state we can and we can't do that
  without you. As always we want to hear what you think about the game whether
  if its positive or negative."

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Quests

    In Open Beta we’re introducing a new system: Quests! Quests, or things like quests have been in the game before but we never found a shape that really fit… until now - we hope! The goals of the quest system are:
    
    - Give players meaningful, strategic decisions in the early game
    - Add immediate, clear, shared early game goals with compelling rewards
    - Incentivize smaller-scale, early game PvP collisions

    While these things will ideally make the game better for all players, we believe they’ll be especially helpful to players that are NOT in a premade, since there’s now a clear answer to what should we do right now?

    And now some caveats. This system came in very late in development so there’s a good amount of temporary content associated with it, like:

    - The vendor is a recolored version of the red key vendor, neither of which are necessarily final in terms of visuals or sound,
    - The way he distributes quests is very bare bones. We’re anticipating iterating here, so please give us feedback on what’s working or not working about interacting with him!
    - Quest content is a pretty small set. We’d like to add more quests if the system sticks around, and we’d like to add more varied quests! We’re still assessing it ourselves and your feedback is a key driver to where we take it, so please let us know how you feel!

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    How quests work:

    - Shortly after you drop, a vendor will appear near your team, offering a selection of different Quests for your team to complete. Your vendor can only be seen and used by your team.
    - Successfully completing those Quests will give your team a unique reward.
    - After you complete your first Quest, your team will be offered another Quest (until Day 4, at which point the Quest vendor will disappear). Each quest offered can be attempted once per game.
    - The vendor will teleport after you every 15 seconds until you accept a quest, or capture a bonfire, or the game reaches day 2. At that point, the vendor will appear above your team’s Base Camp, or if you don’t have one, at the nearest uncaptured one.

    Quests and rewards:

    - Brawlers: Kill 3 players. Reward: Megashard.
    - Farm Creeps: Farm 16 creeps. Reward: 4 Vive Brews + 1 Hyperscrap per player.
    - Open Vault: Open any Vault. Reward: 1 Tome of Knowledge per player + 1 Hyperscrap per player.
    - Supply Drop: Spawn and loot a Supply Drop. Reward: 2 green armor + 1 Hyperscrap per player.
    - Megaboar: Spawn and hunt a Megaboar. Reward: 2 green armor + 1 Hyperscrap per player.
    - Note: you’ll either receive Supply Drop OR Megaboar each match, not both.

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Circle Tunings

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - BR games now start with an initial Death Circle. Gold zones and Major Objectives will not spawn in the initial death circle",
    - For Squad games: Day 1 circle duration lowered by 60s. Subsequent days lowered slightly",

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Most Wanted

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Dying while Most Wanted now sends you straight to Deathbox
    - Kill credit from spikes will always go to the player who hit the spike, and won't be stolen by damaging a player after the spike starts
    - Last hit leniency - if the most wanted player has an assist within 0.5 seconds of a kill, they'll get full kill time reduction instead of assist reduction

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Health/damage reduction clarity

    This change shouldn’t feel like a change. In a previous playtest, we gave all hunters some passive damage reduction as an experiment to increase time-to-kill. We liked the change, so we’re swapping the invisible damage-reduction with health to get the same effect with better clarity.

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Hidden 3% damage reduction and 5% healing reduction removed from all hunters
    - All hunters are given +30 base Health (and a small amount of scaling Health per Level) to compensate for the above removals

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Other Stuff

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - As a reminder, all inventory and progression has been reset for Open Beta
    - The glider “Soft Ceiling” pulls you down less harshly, and should generally feel better
    - The "Out of Bounds" Buffer does not regenerate until you\'re on the ground again (thank you zzkknn for showing us that we need this…)
    - All hunters have received a third Hunter Mastery mission. Some existing Hunter Mastery missions have been modified.
    - You are now Vulnerable while repairing armor at a Basecamp (same as brewing Vive)
    - You can now mute your teammates’ Emotes and Pings in Settings
    - When you are dead, you can only hear sound that your living teammates can hear

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Environment/Map

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - [!!!] Random Chests now spawn in the outskirts of most biomes: they contain goodies!
    - [!!!] Kaiju Water now anti-heals for a short duration
    - [!!!] Explosive barrels now have a slight delay before exploding, and they now apply anti-heal
    - Environment looks nicer :^)
    - Chaos Steppes has an updated layout, including a new Boss arena
    - Prisma Falls has a secret area!

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## PvE
    
    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Several minions have updated loot/XP adjustments to match their density/danger
    - Creeps now ignore you if you sneak around them (unless you’re really really close to them)
    - Wavemaker Boss: Projectile orbs are now destructible by melee attacks
