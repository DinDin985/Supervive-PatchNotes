  # Steam Next Fest Fireside Chat & Patch Notes

  ## BIG WALL OF TEXT JUST WATCH THE VIDEO

  ### DinDin | 10/7/2024

</Introduction>

<Summary authorName={"DinDin"} authorImg={""}>
  We're excited to have our game launch for steam next fest and want to give an update on what's new to Supervive.
</Summary>

<PatchHighlights video={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zx-PPaC39Vk"} img={""}>
  
</PatchHighlights>

<Custom title={"Visual updates"}>
  "A note on the ‘Soul Anchors’ - if you played in the veteran test, we reverted the abyss aiming changes 
  but we have updated the glider balloon visual so it’s easier to understand where to aim to hit the enemy. 
  If that thing is going crazy, hit it!!!!

  Also some of these changes are like... one line but lemme tell ya they're pretty big visual upgrades!"

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  ![Updated in-game HUD](/patch-notes/misc-images/updated-in-game-hud.png 'Updated in-game HUD')

  - The in-game HUD has been updated across the board for style and clarity
  - All Hunter portraits have been updated
  - Many monsters have had their visuals updated
  - Team colors have been updated for higher clarity
  - Hunters use a new aim laser
  - The aim laser now properly follows the path of your aimed projectile up and down terrain
  - Added “Limit Laser to Cursor” setting (under Settings >>> Game) that allows you to adjust whether your aim laser stops at cursor or extends beyond it
  - Several VFX updates have been made, including (but not limited to): Geysers, Most Wanted proc celebration, Ability Reset cue, Invulnerability state (e.g. Freeze Ult), Brush, Stealth, Character fade when Hunters are in the Abyss, Soul Anchors (formerly Glider Balloons), execution warnings, effects around booping, dashing, mantling, walking on water, along with a bunch of Hunter abilities and much more
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Voiceover/Localization"}>
  "Non-English VO is in-progress. If you change your language settings to a non-English language, you might hear 
  some localized voice lines, but it’ll be incomplete."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - Every Hunter has received English Voiceover lines, and several new contextual Announcer recordings have been added
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Cosmetics"}>

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>
  Twitch Drop Emotes
    - Due to player feedback, we’ve swapped the “You think I’m boosted!?” voiceline to a new Twitch Drop emote, and put in a new voiceline for the previous Twitch Drop emote (he now says “Ayy Yo!”)
    - You can still get both emotes from ((Twitch Drops during Steam Next Fest) [https://drops.theorycraftgames.com/] drops.theorycraftgames.com)
    - If for some reason you miss this at the end of Steam Next Fest and have the “Ayy Yo” emote but want the “You think I’m boosted!?” emote, you can DM us on Discord but you'd better have a good reason!!!

  Vive Points Update
    - Vive Points have been divided by 100 but have the exact same functionality - so number smaller but functionality same

  Currency
    - Have been reset. We will reset at least one more time at Open Beta, so feel free to spend it on cosmetics during the playtest
</Custom>

<Custom title={"Map"}>

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  Map Visuals
    - BIG VISUAL UPGRADES ACROSS THE BOARD. We put a lot of work into upgrading our ‘basekit’ for the map, which means a lot of base map textures were improved everywhere

  Plane drops
    - New plane path/drop types have been added. Expect some rare plane paths that are not straight lines!

  Hot Zones [Zones with Gold Armor spawns]
    - Gold Armor zone can be in any biome, not just the outer ones
    - Gold Armor zone can be on the train
    - Chance of all Gold Armors spawning in a single biome increased from 10% >>> 25%

  Academy
  "We like the added texture that Academy brings in giving teams an early XP advantage, but seeing you gremlins come out at level 8 in the first three minutes was less cool."
    - Green Books removed, replaced with more Blue Books
    - Blue Book XP decreased from 125 >>> 50
    - Red Book unchanged

  Vault
    - Common Powers (runes) 20% >>> 15%
    - Uncommon Powers 60% >>> 75%
    - Rare Powers 20% >>> 10%
</Custom>

    ## Damage/Time-to-Kill

    We’re trying to live in this narrow sweet spot of time-to-kill (TTK) where 1vN potential lives 
    (even at the highest level), but there’s still room for back-and-forth fencing. Any higher (ie. 
    high TTK, low lethality) and fights become attrition-heavy with no sharp turns or counterswings 
    (we call these slow plane crashes). And obviously if TTK goes too low (aka super high lethality), 
    we get into “what the hell killed me?” territory. It’s a fine line to walk.

    We’ve also taken on a lot of complexity/noise with our new evolving equipment, so finding that zone 
    is an ongoing journey. If you’ve been following us closely: in our September open test, we increased 
    time-to-kill with a number of armor damage reduction buffs (and tank items were VERY GOOD). Then in 
    our veteran September test, time-to-kill went way down with AP equipment being overtuned (and we combo’d 
    some armor damage reduction changes). Now we’re somewhere in the middle.

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Reverted a change from September playtest that increased baseline Damage Reduction and Armor Damage Reduction across all tiers
    - Armor Damage reduction has been increased to August playtest levels - being unarmored hurts more again
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Audio

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Audio attenuation for enemy attacks increased. You should be able to hear enemy actions from further away
    - Fixed issues with enemy footsteps not playing the correct sounds that distinguish them from ally/your own footsteps
    - Fixed issues with incorrect Glider sounds playing
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Power Shards

    I know this looks like a reason not to share your shards with your teammates, but imagine the 
    EMBARRASSMENT when you get picked and explode like a shard piñata while your teammates look on 
    in their green equipment. Think about that.

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Every unused Power Shard you hold onto grants +2 AP
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Cremation

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Fixed a bug where stomping a Hunter who is Cremated removes the effect
    - Fixing this bug does not mean Cremated Wisps get stomped faster than before
    - Revive bar decay while Cremated (and not being revived) reduced by 50%
    - This means you won't lose your progress reviving an ally as quickly if you have to step off

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Gold Keys

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Can now be used to open Vaults instantly (they can still be used to open Armor Chests)
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Hunter Mastery Missions

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Each Hunter has a unique set of challenges that, when completed, will grant XP towards your Hunter’s journey
    - You can find these missions under Hunters -> Mastery in the Main Menu
    - Each mission also has a unique Callsign as a reward for completion
    - Please note that progress and rewards will reset one more time before Open Beta
  </SystemChanges>
