  # JAN 22 - Leveling Rework + BIG Balance Patch Notes

  ## No more per-day level cap, new ability upgrades, lots of balance changes, and more!

  ### DinDin | 1/22/2025

</Introduction>

<Summary authorName={"DinDin"} authorImg={""}>
  Welcome to the second patch of Season Zero, Arc One, Beebo’s… etc, etc. As with every patch, we’re trying to 
  synthesize all of your feedback into a set of big, experimental changes to improve the game, which we’ll then 
  learn from and continue iterating on in future patches.

  Something to note: making large, systemic changes ends up having cascading effects on other areas of the game 
  (and bugs… so many bugs), of which we sometimes miss. So if you find strange interactions coming from these big 
  changes, please let us know on our Steam forums, Discord, or our social channels.

  Finally: a request we’ve heard from many of you is to get a sort of “state of the game” fireside chat to hear 
  about where SUPERVIVE is heading in the long-term. Heard! We’re thinking about this internally as well, but would 
  like to request a little time as we cook, iterate, and learn for the future. Maybe give us a month or so.
</Summary>

<PatchHighlights video={""} img={"/patch-notes/cover-images/season-zero.png"}>
  This patch will showcase big changes from how leveling works to hunter changes. We are looking forward to making this 
  game the best we can and we need your help. Send us any feedback both positive and negative so together we will make
  this game even better.
</PatchHighlights>

<Custom title={"Battlepass EXP requirement reduction"}>
  "Since this is our first battlepass, we’ve been watching progression/completion rates and are feeling like we 
  tuned this thing too aggressively, so we’re reducing the required EXP to complete the pass by roughly ~50%. We 
  think the average player who plays an average amount of games should be able to reasonably finish the pass.

  Simultaneously, we’ve been mapping out our patch cadence and realized we miscalibrated when the battlepass-ending 
  patch would land - so we need to bring it in a week. All up, this is still a significant ‘buff’ (ie. easier to 
  complete the battlepass) but we’re being transparent that it’s also coming with one less week."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  - Overall, it should take less than half the time to complete the Season Zero, Arc 1 battlepass than before
  - You will need to login and play a game for your battlepass progress to adjust to this patch
  - If you play around 50 hours total and complete most weekly and daily missions, you should be able to finish the battlepass
  - The battlepass end date has been updated to end on April 9th >>> April 2nd
</Custom>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Leveling Rework

    "In an effort to remove some of our more 'rules-y' systems and establish clearer paths to victory, we're 
    testing removing the per-day level cap, increasing the maximum level for all hunters, and increasing equipment 
    upgrade power. What we're hoping to see is that teams have more understandable paths to building a lead (when in 
    doubt: farm for levels and upgrades) and others can better understand how they're behind."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - You will no longer be level-capped depending on the day - instead, monsters will always give EXP, with higher-level monsters giving a lot more
    - Maximum level has been increased from 9 >>> 15
    - All abilities can now be leveled up to 3 >>> 4, with the special bonus unlocking at 4
    - You now gain +10 ability power per level, with base ability power being reduced
    - Base equipment ability power/health has been reduced to 66% of previous values, while upgrades have been increased to 200% of previous values
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## PVP EXP

    "A TL;DR here is: you will now be immediately rewarded for sniping knocks on higher-level teams, which should make 
    comebacks far more immediate (previously you had to stomp the knocked wisp for the EXP, which made it very hard to 
    even take an advantage on a higher level team). Additionally, farming/picking on lower-level teams won’t slam you 
    into a massive lobby advantage because they’ll give less EXP overall."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - A knock is defined as: when you take someone’s health down to 0 and put them into a wisp state. A death or kill is when that player goes into a deathbox state.
    - EXP is now granted at the KNOCK state, rather than the KILL state
    - There are new PVP EXP calculations where knocking targets above your level gives a lot of EXP, scaling down to very little EXP for knocking targets below your level (so try to pick that juicy high-level target for a comeback)
    - Repeated knocks on the same victim diminish by 50% each time (no blood bags pls)
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Minions/PvE

    "With a higher weight being placed on PvE farming, we’re making these guys a little easier to farm and solo."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    Base Stats and Rewards
      - Minions now spawn between level 6-15, rewards/level adjusted appropriately
      - Minion backstab gone, except for Magma Brutes and Sand Brutes
      - Minions now give 75% of the gold they used to give to account for more overall gold in the game due to more PvE farming
    
    Counter damage and vulnerable state
      - Counter damage means the damage the monster takes when you counter them (that is, using a boop/displacement/crowd control effect on a monster when it’s winding up with that blue circle under it). Vulnerable state is when the monster takes 2X bonus damage for a period of time after being countered. If you didn’t know about these things, then your PvEing is about to get a lot faster!
      - Vulnerable state duration increased from 3.5 >>> 5 seconds
      - Squad leader counter damage up from 40% >>> 60% total health
      - Corrupted Guardian (biome leaders that spawn after clearing all monsters in the area) counter damage up from 5% >> 30% total health
      - Abyssal Hatchlings up from 5% >> 30% total health
      - Meteor Beast counter damage is 5% (unchanged) total health
      - Final Abyssal counter damage up from 5% >>> 10% total health
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## EXP Meteor Soul

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Level 14 & 15 now grant an ability point so you can take all your abilities to level 4
    - If you acquire the EXP Meteor Soul at level 14, you'll instantly get 1 ability point
    - If you acquire the EXP Meteor Soul at level 15, you'll instantly get 2 abilities points
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Arena

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Players begin at Level 15, with 1 ability point to spend on a Level 4 ability
    - Will match Arena behavior with the old levels

  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Day/Night 1 Revival Rules

    "We’re trying to reduce the endless lemming-zerg that happens on day 1 (especially at high level play). 
    This should at least make things more manageable if a team is trying to slam bodies into an objective. In the 
    next patch we’ll also offer the ability to turn off this rule in custom games."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Timer is now based on how many times your TEAM has used a respawn (25 > 30 > 35 > 40 > 45 > 50 seconds)
    - Previously it was the same sequence, but it would only increase when you INDIVIDUALLY respawned
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Spell buffering changes

    "Goal here is to better associate the output of a spell with the input. Currently, there are times where 
    spells activate long enough after the button press such that it no longer feels a part of the action. This 
    should also reduce the number of unintended spell casts."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Ability buffering means: when you press a button and can’t fire an ability for some reason (eg. you’re crowd controlled, there’s an overriding input, etc), the game will ‘preserve’ that intent for a little bit and keep trying to fire the ability
    - Lowered the default buffer window from 0.3 >>> 0.2 seconds
  </SystemChanges>

  <SystemChanges>
    ## Mana

    "We’re asking you to fight a lot these days, which is resulting in a lot of sad third/fourth/fifth-partying 
    shenanigans. So we’re trying to even the playing field for the fight-winning teams."

    <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    - Your mana is refilled upon knocking an enemy Hunter
  </SystemChanges>
</SystemChangesContainer>

<HunterChangesContainer>
  <HunterChanges imgBig={"/patch-notes/hunter-portraits/beebo-full-body-cropped.png"} imgSmall={"/patch-notes/hunter-icons/beebo.png"}>

      <HunterAbilityChangesContainer>
        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={""} abilityName={"Base Stats"}>
            - Toughness increased from 3 >>> 3.5

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/beebo/Q.png"} abilityName={"(Q) - Beeb-omb"}>

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/beebo/RMB.png"} abilityName={"(RMB) - Zeep Zeep"}>
          - Fire Zeep’s damage-over-time now deals lethal damage
          - Bugfix: Spell is no longer cast when leveled up
        </HunterAbilityChanges>

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/beebo/R.png"} abilityName={"(R) - Tonk Tonk"}>
          - Bugfix: Kart is no longer instantly destroyed when spell is cast near terrain
          - Bugfix: General Kart behavior should be a (somewhat) smoother ride

  <HunterChanges imgBig={"/patch-notes/hunter-portraits/brall-full-body-cropped.png"} imgSmall={"/patch-notes/hunter-icons/brall.png"}>
      ## Brall

      #### 

      ### "We want Brall to feel like an exciting, skill-expressive Hunter. These changes are targeted towards shifting away from LMBrall and reducing his oppressive mobility.

      ### Historically, some of the worst feelings playing against Brall have come from him being able to repeatedly get value out of LMB without a whole lot of intentionality (SWOSH SWOSH SWOSH SWOSH). With this set of changes, we’re looking to introduce more mechanical skill-expression in both the “playing-as” and “playing-against” cases. Bralls will have to aim and track their targets better, whereas opponents will have more opportunity to use their movement options to dodge and weave."

      <Hr className="hidden w-11/12 mb-8 lg:block" />

        </HunterAbilityChanges>

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/brall/shift.png"} abilityName={"(Shift) - Flame Step"}>

      ## Celeste

      #### 

      ### "These changes are intended to sharpen Celeste’s role as a space controller on top of giving her more sandbox tools where she can really affect the shape of the battlefield. For the Celeste mains out there that specifically like to duel, these RMB changes are intended to provide more mechanical interest and options."

      <Hr className="hidden w-11/12 mb-8 lg:block" />

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/celeste/rmb.png"} abilityName={"(RMB) - Cryo Spear"}>

        </HunterAbilityChanges>

        <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/celeste/shift.png"} abilityName={"(Shift) - Skate "}>
          - LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: Now creates ice islands underneath Celeste when she dashes over abyss
            - Repeatedly doing this over the abyss will reduce the lifetime of the ice islands
            - This resets if Celeste hasn’t dashed over the abyss for at least 20 seconds
        </HunterAbilityChanges>
        
         <HunterAbilityChanges abilityImg={"/patch-notes/hunter-abilities/celeste/Q.png"} abilityName={"(Q) - Frozen Barricade"}>

      ## Elluna

      #### 

      ### "With the earlier changes we made to Wisp burnout time, we wanted to give Elluna more options around her unique strength of picking up allies. We also remember there have been previous versions where Elluna had too much power in this respect. This is an attempt to give some of that back while still introducing meaningful windows for responses and counterplay. And for all the Brawllunas out there, check that level 4 upgrade on Righteous Root."

For Voids that like to duke it out or find themselves pushed by other hunters, the Void Snap changes are intended to give you more maneuverability to either disengage or follow-up. For the more utility-oriented Void players, we thought that sharpening the defensive output from this ability upgrade would help you find more reliable value."

      ### "We think bunnyhopping (that is: using well-timed jumps to preserve forward momentum) on Zeph is cool and it’s a mechanic we want to keep. At the same time, being able to do so continuously without consequence has proven to be too much power (note: we’re aware other Hunters can also bunnyhop but that change had complications, so if you know you know and we’ll nerf it next time). Admin, he’s doing it sideways! (if you understood this reference, congratulations you’re old as hell)"

      ### "More farming, more gold, more Gnarl Hearts. While we always love a good Gnarl Heart into the “really silly endgame puzzle” play, we think it should be a hard-commit strategy to get the necessary gold."
    <ConsumableSpecificChangesContainer>
      - Increased price from 75,000 >>> 112,500 gold

  ## Academy

  "A nerf to all you yimyams who were looting the academy, reading all the books, and then teleporting out."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

    ### Academy Anomaly
      - The Anomaly will now be OFF at game start
      - The Anomaly will turn ON at the beginning of Day 2

  ## Wellspring

  "Wellspring’s needed an update for a while. The area’s felt a little crowded with the different elements - vines, 
  wind rings, abyss, geysers. The wind rings and the large amount of abyss also generally let you bypass needing to 
  play around the geysers as the main traversal tool for the high ground surrounding it. We’re doubling down on this 
  area’s namesake so this biome is giving its intended combat texture."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

   - Removed most Glide Rings from the biome
   - Added a larger geyser at the center of Wellspring
   - Reduce some of the abyss
   - Better pathing from Desert traveling north into Wellspring

<Custom title={"Team Communications"}>
  "SUPERVIVE is most fun when you work together. We’re exploring ways to make it easier to non-verbally coordinate with teammates."

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  ## Ping Updates

  "Two goals - one is to add more fidelity to non-verbal ping communication so that you can communicate intent easier, 
  and the other is to update ping voiceover to better match player intention."

    - You can now double-press the ping button to issue a red "Enemy Here" ping
    - "Let's Go Here" voiceover (VO) plays on default (ground) pings
    - "I'm Going Here" VO now plays when the ping wheel's green arrow is used (used to play “Let’s Go Here”)

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  ## Contextual Ping Updates

  - Ping your HP bar to print your current HP & Mana into the chat
    - If your HP is below 50% your Hunter will also say "I'm hurt!"
    - If your HP is above 50%, but your mana is below 33%, your Hunter will say "I'm out of mana!"
  
  - Ping your empty food to say "I need food!"
  - Ping Vaults to say "Vault here!"
  - Pinging Armor now correctly says "Loot here!"
  - Updated chat messages associated with various contextual pings to improve clarity
  
  - Using "Anywhere But Here" scroll or Teleport Soul now plays "I'm teleporting!" VO (used to say “I’m recalling”)
  
  - You can now emote while dead to communicate important messages such as “Airhorn” to your teammates
  - Emotes from dead Hunters have a radio effect on their audio to make clear that the person speaking is speaking from beyond their grave

  <Hr className="mb-5"/>

  ## Emotes

  "We’ve added VO to the Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down emotes (unlocked early in Hunter’s Journey) with the intention of making them more effective communication tools. Consider using these to inform allies that you agree… or disagree."

  - Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down emote VO
    - “Thumbs Up” emote now plays “Roger That” VO
    - “Thumbs Down” emote now plays “No thanks / Nope” VO

  - Decreased the number of Emote audio instances that can play simultaneously
